  Next Steps for Enhancement

  1. Add architectural energy breakdowns to comparison output when energy models are configured
  2. Implement export formats: JSON, CSV, HTML with interactive charts
  3. Add visualization: Terminal heatmaps, bar charts using rich library
  4. Support custom models: Beyond torchvision (user-provided PyTorch modules)
  5. Add cost analysis: $/inference based on cloud pricing
  6. Batch sweep mode: Automatically compare across batch sizes

I can help you create this architecture document, but I need to understand the specifics of your KPU architecture first. I'm not familiar with the Stillwater Knowledge Processing Unit or its Domain Flow Architecture implementation - these appear to be specialized systems that aren't in my training data.

To create a useful markdown document that Claude Code can effectively parse for energy modeling, I'll need you to provide:

1. **Core architectural components** - What processing units, memory hierarchies, interconnects, and control structures make up the KPU?

2. **Operational model** - How does it process knowledge? What are the key computational stages?

3. **Data flow patterns** - How does data move through the system? What are the primary paths?

4. **Energy-relevant operations** - What operations do you already know are significant energy consumers? (e.g., memory access patterns, arithmetic operations, data transfers, synchronization events)

5. **Domain Flow Architecture specifics** - What makes this architecture distinct? What are its key design principles?

Once you provide these details, I can structure the markdown document with clear sections that will make it straightforward for Claude Code to identify and extract energy-consuming events. The document should probably include explicit sections for computational operations, memory access patterns, communication events, and control flow - all tagged in a way that facilitates automated extraction.

What details can you share about the KPU architecture?

The document is ready for Section 2, which needs the KPU-specific specializations. What components or enhancements does the KPU add to the base DFA architecture? For example:

Specialized PE types or instructions?
Additional memory hierarchies or caches?
Specific operator accelerators (attention mechanisms, activations, quantization)?
Modified streaming patterns or fabric topologies?
Knowledge representation structures?
